## 📖 About the Project

Built with a cross-platform architecture, this Unreal Engine Middleware provides a unified solution for integrating DualSense™ (PlayStation 5) and DualShock 4® (PlayStation 4) controllers. It delivers native support on PC while being architected for easy compilation across other Unreal Engine platforms, including PlayStation®. This asset provides direct API access to the complete feature set of each controller, including the revolutionary Haptic Feedback and Adaptive Triggers of the DualSense™. All features are exposed through a clean and well-documented function library for both Blueprint and C++.

Designed to bridge the gap left by generic controller support, this asset empowers developers to implement the high-fidelity, immersive feedback that makes Sony's controllers unique.

## ✨ Features
* 🏗️ **Extensible Multi-Platform Architecture**: Its flexible design enables compilation across all Unreal Engine platforms. Supporting new hardware is as simple as implementing the connection interface.
* 🔌 **Dynamic Connection (Hot-Swap)**: Automatically detects controller connection and disconnection, even during gameplay.
* ⚡ **Optimized for Multiplayer**: High-performance architecture with minimal impact on network games.
* 🎮 **Seamless Input Integration**: Coexists perfectly with Unreal Engine's native input managers (like Enhanced Input) and other gamepad Middlewares, preventing conflicts between devices.
* 🎧 **Audio Haptics (USB & Wireless)**: Haptic feedback based on in-game audio.
* 🎯 **Adaptive Triggers**: Full control over resistance, effect, and vibration on R2/L2 triggers.
* 💡 **Lightbar Control**: Dynamically change the controller's LED color.
* 🎤 **Smart Mute Detection** — Automatic mute LED control, no coding required
* ⚙️ **Force Feedback**: Native integration with Unreal Engine's Force Feedback system for standard motor vibration.
* 🎮 **Multi-Controller Support**: Manage up to 4 controllers simultaneously.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Installation

Go to the official page on the Unreal Engine Marketplace (FAB): **[Middleware Gold Edition - FAB](https://www.fab.com/listings/d0836635-91a8-42cb-a78f-d34456cc042c)**

### 🔒 V2 Gold Version Access (Exclusive for Buyers)

If you have purchased the Gold version, your purchase verification grants you full access to the private GitHub repository, which includes:

* **Full & Detailed Documentation:** Comprehensive guides to get you started quickly.
* **Practical Examples:** Hands-on integration samples for features like high-fidelity audio and audio-based haptics (vibration) over both Bluetooth and USB.

### ⚠️ Important: How to Request Access

Click the link below to provide your GitHub username and Order ID:
👉 **[Fill out the Access Form](https://forms.gle/bis7RqWbweis1UyZA)**

* **Already bought the Gold Edition?** Just fill out the form with your Gold Order ID.
* **Upgrading from Controller Support v2?** If you purchased the v2 version on FAB up until **May 16th, 2026**, you are eligible for a free migration. Simply fill out the form using your v2 Order ID.

*Access is usually granted within 24 hours. You will receive a GitHub invitation via email or directly in your platform notifications.*

### Manual Installation

To ensure the Middleware compiles correctly within Unreal Engine, you must configure the [GamepadCore](https://github.com/rafaelvaloto/GamepadCore_) submodule.

Please run the following commands in your terminal (Git Bash, PowerShell, or CMD):
```bash
# Clone the repository at version (tag)
git clone -b [tag] --single-branch https://github.com/rafaelvaloto/Unreal-Dualsense.git
```
```bash
# Clone the repository at master branch
git clone https://github.com/rafaelvaloto/Unreal-Dualsense.git

# Enter the repository folder
cd Unreal-Dualsense

# Init the submodule to the latest version
git submodule update --init

```
    
## 💻 Basic Usage

The Middleware exposes all functionality through static Blueprint function libraries, meaning you can call methods from anywhere without needing to add components.

### Blueprint Function Libraries

The functions are divided into two main categories for easy access:

* **Sony Gamepad**: Contains management methods common to Sony controllers (DualShock and DualSense), such as LED control, gyroscope, battery level, etc.
* **DualSense Effects**: Contains methods specific to DualSense exclusive features, such as Adaptive Triggers configuration.

Call functions directly to control DualSense features. Some available effects include:

### 📚 For the full documentation, please see the **[Wiki](https://github.com/rafaelvaloto/WindowsDualsenseUnreal/wiki)**.


## 🎮 Example Project: Arena Shooter UE 5.6

To demonstrate the practical use of the **Dualsense Unreal Middleware**, a sample project has been developed using the [*Arena Shooter* template](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/arena-shooter-template) and upgraded to Unreal Engine 5.6. This project integrates key features of the DualSense controller to enhance the player's experience.

### Implemented Features

In this sample, the following DualSense functionalities were integrated to provide a more immersive gameplay experience:

* 🔫 **Automatic Gun**: Experience fully automatic firing with appropriate haptic feedback, simulating realistic weapon recoil and vibration.
* 🎯 **Semi-Automatic Gun**: Engage in precise shooting with semi-automatic weapons, where each shot provides distinct haptic sensations and trigger resistance.
* 💥 **Vibration on Player Hit & Visual Feedback**: Feel the impact! The controller vibrates dynamically when the player takes damage, complemented by on-screen visual feedback for enhanced immersion and immediate awareness.
* 💡 **LED Color Change on Player Hit**: The DualSense controller's LED light dynamically changes color when the player is hit, offering an immediate and intuitive visual cue of damage taken, enhancing situational awareness.

### Where to Download

You can download the *Arena Shooter UE 5.6* with the DualSense integration directly from link.

### 🎓 Hands-On Tutorial

We've created a detailed, step-by-step tutorial that breaks down the entire implementation within the example project. It's the perfect guide to get you started.

## 🎮 Example Project: Audio and Audio Haptics (USB & Wireless)

Take your immersion to the next level! This update enhances the advanced Audio Haptics feature, allowing it to work seamlessly via both USB and wirelessly via Bluetooth (previously USB-only). This new example project demonstrates how to harness this power, featuring a complete implementation for real-time haptic feedback based on in-game audio.

## 💉 Injecting Custom Device Logic (Custom DeviceManager)
Since version 2.0.0, you can also inject a custom implementation of the `DeviceManager`. This is useful if you want to implement your own input buffering, custom button mapping, or specialized haptic logic without modifying the Middleware source.

> [!TIP]
> To ensure that your custom implementation works with native Unreal Engine assets (like **Haptic Feedback Effects**, **Force Feedback Assets**, and **Device Properties**), your class must correctly implement or override the methods from `IInputDevice` and `IHapticDevice`.

### Required Interfaces for Native Assets

If you want your custom manager to support native Unreal features, ensure it implements/overrides:

*   **`IHapticDevice`**: haptic assets.
    *   `SetHapticFeedbackValues`: Processes frequency and amplitude values from assets.
    *   `GetHapticFrequencyRange`: Determines the valid frequency range supported by the device.
    *   `GetHapticAmplitudeScale`: Returns the scaling factor for amplitude mapping.
*   **`IInputDevice`**: Required for standard vibration, light color, and properties.
    *   `SetChannelValues` / `SetChannelValue`: Essential for `UForceFeedbackEffect` assets.
    *   `SetLightColor` / `ResetLightColor`: Controls the controller's LED.
    *   `SetDeviceProperty`: Handles `UInputDeviceProperty` (e.g., Adaptive Triggers via Unreal 5.1+ system).
    *   `GetHapticDevice`: Returns the `IHapticDevice*` interface (usually `return this;`).
    *   `IsGamepadAttached`: Returns whether the device is currently connected.
