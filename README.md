## 📖 About the Project

This is an Unreal Engine plugin that enables native communication with DualSense™ (PlayStation 5) and DualShock 4® (PlayStation 4) controllers on systems. It exposes the unique features of each controller, such as Haptic Feedback and Adaptive Triggers of DualSense, through an easy-to-use Blueprint and C++ function library.

The goal is to bridge the gap left by generic controller support, giving developers direct access to the features that make Sony controllers so immersive.

## ✨ Features
* 🏗️ **Extensible Multi-Platform Architecture**: Its flexible design enables compilation across all Unreal Engine platforms. Supporting new hardware is as simple as implementing the connection interface.
* 🔌 **Dynamic Connection (Hot-Swap)**: Automatically detects controller connection and disconnection, even during gameplay.
* ⚡ **Optimized for Multiplayer**: High-performance architecture with minimal impact on network games.
* 🎮 **Seamless Input Integration**: Coexists perfectly with Unreal Engine's native input managers (like Enhanced Input) and other gamepad plugins, preventing conflicts between devices.
* 🎯 **Adaptive Triggers**: Full control over resistance, effect, and vibration on R2/L2 triggers.
* 🔊 **Audio-Based Vibration**: Synchronize the controller's haptic feedback with any in-game audio source.
* 💡 **Lightbar Control**: Dynamically change the controller's LED color.
* 🎤 **Microphone and Audio**: Manage the mute button LED, speaker volume, and headset audio.
* ⚙️ **Force Feedback**: Native integration with Unreal Engine's Force Feedback system for standard motor vibration.
* 🎮 **Multi-Controller Support**: Manage up to 4 controllers simultaneously.

## 🎮 Example Project: Arena Shooter UE 5.6

To demonstrate the practical use of the **Dualsense Unreal Plugin**, a sample project has been developed using the [*Arena Shooter* template](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/arena-shooter-template) and upgraded to Unreal Engine 5.6. This project integrates key features of the DualSense controller to enhance the player's experience.

### Implemented Features

In this sample, the following DualSense functionalities were integrated to provide a more immersive gameplay experience:

* 🔫 **Automatic Gun**: Experience fully automatic firing with appropriate haptic feedback, simulating realistic weapon recoil and vibration.
* 🎯 **Semi-Automatic Gun**: Engage in precise shooting with semi-automatic weapons, where each shot provides distinct haptic sensations and trigger resistance.
* 💥 **Vibration on Player Hit & Visual Feedback**: Feel the impact! The controller vibrates dynamically when the player takes damage, complemented by on-screen visual feedback for enhanced immersion and immediate awareness.
* 💡 **LED Color Change on Player Hit**: The DualSense controller's LED light dynamically changes color when the player is hit, offering an immediate and intuitive visual cue of damage taken, enhancing situational awareness.

## 🎮 Example Project: Parrot Game Sample

To demonstrate the practical use of the **Windows Dualsense Unreal Plugin**, a sample project has been developed using the [*Parrot Game Sample*](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/parrot-game-sample-for-unreal-engine) from Epic Games. This project integrates key features of the DualSense controller to enhance the player's experience.

![Parrot Game Sample](Images/parrot-game-sample-banner.jpg)


### Implemented Features

In this sample, the following DualSense functionalities were integrated to provide a more immersive gameplay experience:

* **Visual Feedback**: The controller's Lightbar is used to provide real-time visual feedback to the player, changing colors and effects according to in-game events.
* **Vibration (Force Feedback)**: The native Force Feedback system was used to create detailed vibration effects, increasing immersion during key moments of gameplay.

> 💡 **Pro Tip for Deeper Immersion**: For an enhanced audio experience, connect the controller via USB and plug a headset directly into it. This setup also works with a Bluetooth connection, offering greater flexibility.

This project serves as a practical guide for developers who want to see the plugin in action and learn how to integrate the unique features of the DualSense controller into their own games.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Unreal Engine**: 5.2 or higher.
* **Operating System**: Windows 10 or 11.
* **Controller**: DualSense™ or DualShock 4®.

### Quick Installation

1.  Go to the official plugin page on the Unreal Engine Marketplace (FAB): [Plugin Page - FAB](https://www.fab.com/listings/e77a8f1d-8bbe-4673-a5ae-7f222c8c0960)
2.  Click **Install** or **Add to Project** and select your Unreal Engine project.
3.  Activate the plugin in Unreal Engine:
    * Open your project.
    * Go to `Edit > Plugins`.
    * Search for **Windows Dualsense Plugin** and check the box.
4.  Restart Unreal Engine when prompted.

## 💻 Basic Usage

The plugin exposes all functionality through static Blueprint function libraries, meaning you can call methods from anywhere without needing to add components.

### Blueprint Function Libraries

The functions are divided into two main categories for easy access:

* **Sony Gamepad**: Contains management methods common to Sony controllers (DualShock and DualSense), such as LED control, gyroscope, battery level, etc.
* **DualSense Effects**: Contains methods specific to DualSense exclusive features, such as Adaptive Triggers configuration.
  
Call functions directly to control DualSense features. Some available effects include:

* 🐎 **Galloping**: Simulates a horse's trot.
* 💪 **Resistance**: Applies constant opposing force when pressing the trigger.
* 🔫 **Weapon**: Creates a recoil effect for semi-automatic weapons.
* 🔥 **Automatic Gun**: Vibrates rapidly to simulate an automatic weapon.

## 🛠️ Extending for Other Platforms (e.g., PlayStation)

The plugin has been designed with an extensible architecture, allowing developers with access to other platform SDKs (such as the official Sony PlayStation® SDK) to integrate them with minimal effort.

The low-level hardware communication is abstracted through the IPlatformHardwareInfoInterface. The default implementation for Windows uses the HID API to communicate with the controllers.

For licensed developers, extending the plugin involves these steps:

Create a new implementation class: Create a new C++ class that inherits from IPlatformHardwareInfoInterface and implements its virtual methods using the specific SDK's functions.

Modify the Singleton: In the IPlatformHardwareInfoInterface.cpp file, include the header for your new class and instantiate it within the appropriate conditional compilation block.

```c++
// IPlatformHardwareInfoInterface.cpp

#if PLATFORM_WINDOWS
    // For Windows, the HID implementation is used.
    PlatformInfoInstance = TUniquePtr<IPlatformHardwareInfoInterface>(new FHIDDeviceInfo());

#elif PLATFORM_SONY // (PLATFORM_PS4 || PLATFORM_PS5)
    // FOR LICENSED DEVELOPERS:
    // 1. Create your class, e.g., "FPlayStationSDKInterface", that implements IPlatformHardwareInfoInterface.
    // 2. Include its header here.
    // 3. Replace "FNullHardwareInterface" with your class name.
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Example: PlatformInfoInstance = TUniquePtr<IPlatformHardwareInfoInterface>(new FPlayStationSDKInterface());
    
    // By default, it uses a null implementation to allow compilation without the SDK.
    PlatformInfoInstance = TUniquePtr<IPlatformHardwareInfoInterface>(new FNullHardwareInterface());
    
#else
    // For all other platforms, a null implementation is used.
    PlatformInfoInstance = TUniquePtr<IPlatformHardwareInfoInterface>(new FNullHardwareInterface());
#endif
```
