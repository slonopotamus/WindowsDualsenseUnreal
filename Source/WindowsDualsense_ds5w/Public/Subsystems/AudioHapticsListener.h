/**
 Class responsible for handling audio submix buffers and preparing audio data for haptic feedback systems.
 
 FAudioHapticsListener integrates with the audio rendering pipeline using the ISubmixBufferListener interface,
 allowing real-time access to submix audio buffers. The class supports processing, conversion, and resampling
 of audio data for use in haptic feedback hardware or systems. It includes mechanisms to manage resampling state
 and an internal queue for storing processed audio data.
